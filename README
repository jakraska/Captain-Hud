Having trouble assigning and announcing positions before a scrim or match? 
Captain Hud stores your players most frequent positions and allows you to 
quickly filter your roster based on current in game players and their roles. 
Once you select your lineup simply hit the "announce" button and all the 
players positions will be posted in team chat. 

To install, place the .vl2 file in your base folder, and assign a key to
captain hud.
